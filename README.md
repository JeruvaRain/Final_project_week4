# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## This repository was made by Juan Rivera for the final project of the course from the John Hopkins University.

The dataset belongs to this link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The files included in this repository are the followings:

1. Codebook.pdf
  Which contains the codebook.
2. run_analysis.r
  Which contains the five steps required to complete the project.
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. Data.txt
  The exported data with the same sequence of the run_analysis.r
